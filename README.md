Partial Response
================

This project provides a library to help with the processing and implementation of
[partial response](http://googlecode.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/making-apis-faster-introducing-partial.html) in an API.

The core library consists of parsers, AST, visitors and matcher for working with a partial response value. Higher level
functionality may be added over time including http filters for xml and json to post process your responses for
inclusion in the partial response.
